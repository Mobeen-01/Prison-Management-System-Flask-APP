## Introduction

The **Prison Management System** is a web-based application designed to automate the routine functions of prison management. This system helps manage prisoner records, track their locations, movements, and sentencing details while ensuring efficient and streamlined operations for prison staff. The system is built to replace the outdated manual methods currently in use, addressing issues such as record mismanagement, redundancy, and inefficient access to data.

By automating prisoner data entry, updating records, and retrieving information, this system ensures that both government authorities and prison staff can efficiently manage prisoner details, court reports, and other critical data with ease. The primary goal of the system is to enhance operational efficiency, accuracy, and reduce the reliance on manual processes.

## Features
